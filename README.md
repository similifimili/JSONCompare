## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-compare-tool.git
cd text-compare-tool
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies

Only the standard Python library is used — no extra installation required for dependencies.

✅ Requires: `Python 3.7+`

### 3. Run the application

```bash

## 🧪 Example

**Input A:**
```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 30
}
```

**Input B:**
